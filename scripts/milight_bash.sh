#For example dimming Green, then switching to White full brightness, and when you go back to a specific color the brightness returns

#White and specifically for the ColorRGB.

#First byte x40 says change colour , second byte is the colour that you want.

#Usage note when using these commands they will impact the current active group for example if you previously typed "./bashlight group2on" then

#or if you wanted to make only group 1 red then type "./bashlight group1on" first then "./bashlight col_red"
